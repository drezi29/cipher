## General information
The project includes an implementation of ROT algorithm. </br>
It allows the use of rotations between 1 and 126. </br>
Rotations between 1 and 25 are performed on the Latin alphabet (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ). </br>
Rotations in the range 26-126 are performed on the character set from the ASCII character table from character 33 (!) to character 126 (~). </br>
The program supports loading data into the program from a JSON file, as well as writing decrypted or encrypted data to a file in JSON format. </br>
The user can also manually enter messages to be encrypted or decrypted and then save them to a file. </br>
